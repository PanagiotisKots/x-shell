## **Project Overview**

**XShell** is a custom Unix shell designed specifically for Linux distributions. It provides basic shell functionality with enhanced features such as job control, command history, and pipelining. Built to function within the terminal, XShell supports the execution of both built-in commands and external programs, allowing users to interact with the system and manage processes.

## **Key Features**

| Feature           | Description                                                                                                       |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Job Control**    | *XShell* allows users to run processes in the background and bring them to the foreground as needed. Commands like `jobs`, `fg`, and `bg` enable efficient process management. |
| **Command History**| With support for command history, *XShell* enables users to recall and execute previously run commands using the arrow keys or the `history` command. |
| **Built-in Commands** | *XShell* includes several built-in commands for common tasks: <br> `cd`: Change the current directory. <br> `help`: Display help information about the shell. <br> `exit`: Exit the shell. <br> `history`: View the history of executed commands. <br> `jobs`: List all background jobs. <br> `fg`: Bring a background job to the foreground. <br> `bg`: Resume a stopped job in the background. |



- **External Command Execution**:  
  *XShell* can execute external programs and commands, making it versatile for interacting with the operating system. It also supports the execution of processes in the background by appending `&` to a command.

---

## **Design and Purpose**

*XShell* is designed to be lightweight and functional, offering a simplified yet powerful alternative to more complex shells like **Bash** or **Zsh**. It has been fully tested on Debian-based Linux distributions and aims to provide an intuitive experience for users who need basic shell capabilities with added support for job control and history.

This shell is ideal for users who want to manage processes and commands efficiently without the overhead of a more feature-heavy environment. *XShell* is built with simplicity in mind, offering just the right amount of functionality for most day-to-day tasks in a Linux terminal environment.





# Installation

**XShell** requires both the GNU Readline and History libraries to handle command input, history, and line editing. The installation process may vary depending on your Linux distribution. Follow the instructions below to install the necessary dependencies and run XShell.

## 1. Install Dependencies

### Ubuntu/Debian-based Distributions

For Ubuntu or other Debian-based distributions, install the necessary development libraries:


    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install libreadline-dev libhistory-dev

### Red Hat/Fedora-based Distributions

On Fedora, Red Hat, or CentOS, use dnf to install the required libraries:

    sudo dnf install readline-devel history-devel

### Arch Linux-based Distributions

On Arch Linux or Manjaro, use pacman to install the libraries:

    sudo pacman -S readline

(Note: Arch-based distributions generally include history functionality with readline, so a separate libhistory package is not needed.)


## 2. Compile XShell

After installing the dependencies, compile XShell using gcc, linking both readline and history libraries:



    gcc -o xshell shell.c -lreadline -lhistory

This command compiles the shell.c file and links the readline and history libraries to create the executable xshell.


## 3. Running XShell

Once compiled, run XShell with the following command:


     sudo su
     
    ./xshell

## 4. Uninstallation

To remove the installed dependencies:
Ubuntu/Debian-based:

    sudo apt remove libreadline-dev libhistory-dev

Fedora-based:

    sudo dnf remove readline-devel history-devel

Arch Linux-based:


    sudo pacman -R readline

Basic Usage

## 1. Changing Directories

Use the cd command to change the current working directory:


    cd /path/to/directory

## 2. Running External Programs

You can run any external program, including running processes in the background by appending &:



    ./my_program &

## 3. Managing Jobs

XShell provides built-in job control:

    List Jobs:


jobs

    Bring Job to Foreground:


fg PID

    Send Job to Background:


bg PID

## 4. Command History

XShell uses the History library to manage command history:

    View History:


history

    Recall Commands:
    Use the up/down arrow keys to navigate previously entered commands.

## 5. Exiting XShell

To exit XShell, use the exit command:

exit

Troubleshooting
Common Errors

    readline/readline.h or history/history.h not found:
    Ensure you have installed both libreadline-dev and libhistory-dev (or the equivalent for your distribution).

    Compile Errors:
    Ensure both readline and history libraries are properly linked during compilation:


gcc -o xshell shell.c -lreadline -lhistory
