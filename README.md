XShell (Extended Shell)
Project Overview

XShell is a custom Unix shell designed specifically for Linux distributions. It provides basic shell functionality with enhanced features such as job control, command history, and pipelining. Built to function within the terminal, XShell supports the execution of both built-in commands and external programs, allowing users to interact with the system and manage processes seamlessly.
Key Features

    Job Control: XShell allows users to run processes in the background and bring them to the foreground as needed. Commands like jobs, fg, and bg enable efficient process management.

    Command History: With support for command history, XShell enables users to recall and execute previously run commands using the arrow keys or the history command.

    Built-in Commands: XShell includes several built-in commands for common tasks, such as:
        cd: Change the current directory.
        help: Display help information about the shell.
        exit: Exit the shell.
        history: View the history of executed commands.
        jobs: List all background jobs.
        fg: Bring a background job to the foreground.
        bg: Resume a stopped job in the background.

    External Command Execution: XShell can execute external programs and commands, making it versatile for interacting with the operating system. It also supports the execution of processes in the background by appending & to a command.

Design and Purpose

XShell is designed to be lightweight and functional, offering a simplified yet powerful alternative to more complex shells like Bash or Zsh. It has been fully tested on Debian-based Linux distributions and aims to provide an intuitive experience for users who need basic shell capabilities with added support for job control and history.

This shell is ideal for users who want to manage processes and commands efficiently without the overhead of a more feature-heavy environment. XShell is built with simplicity in mind, offering just the right amount of functionality for most day-to-day tasks in a Linux terminal environment.
